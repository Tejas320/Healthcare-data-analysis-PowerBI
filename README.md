## Introduction
The healthcare industry generates vast amounts of data daily, presenting a challenge in transforming this data into actionable insights. Leveraging Power BI, healthcare organizations can harness this data to make informed, data-driven decisions. This approach aims to enhance patient care, streamline operations, and improve overall healthcare outcomes. By visualizing key metrics and trends, stakeholders can identify areas for improvement and implement evidence-based strategies effectively.
## Objectives
1. Disease Analysis basing on Smoking Habit
2. Disease Analysis basing on Alcohol Habit
3. Count of Patients Visit by Week Name
4. Count of Patients by Age Group
5. Percent of Male and Female Patients
6. Average duration of Stay in the Hospital
## Visualizations
1. Created a decomposition tree showcasing the number of patients who smoke and are having lungs disease, neuro disease and chronic kidney disease (CKD)
